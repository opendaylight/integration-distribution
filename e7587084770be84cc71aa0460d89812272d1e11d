      "message": "My idea was that $KARAF/bin currently only has *.sh \u0026 *.bat, and no *.jar ... those *.sh \u0026 *.bat then call the *.jar that are elsewhere.. for example karaf-client.jar, used by bin/client[.bat] is in lib/bin - so I put this there as well.  In the future perhaps someone (not me...) would like to write an ~aaa.sh|.bat and but that into bin/, invoking java -jar lib/bin/aaa-cli-jar.jar.  Makes sense?",
