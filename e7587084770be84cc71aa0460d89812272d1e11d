      "message": "My idea was that $KARAF/bin currently only has *.sh \u0026 *.bat, and no *.jar ... those *.sh \u0026 *.bat then call the *.jar that are elsewhere.. for example karaf-client.jar, used by bin/client[.bat] is in lib/bin - so I put this there as well.  In the future perhaps someone (not me...) would like to write an ~aaa.sh|.bat and but that into bin/, invoking java -jar lib/bin/aaa-cli-jar.jar.  Makes sense?",

But currently we do not have them.\n\nBasically, user is either supposed to use aaa-cli-jar manually (in which case it should be in bin/), or the user should use a script instead (which means this Change just adds a dependency for a feature that does not exist).\n\nI am against merging dependencies before anyone benefits them.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe there will be user-friendly script, but power users may still want to run aaa-cli-jar directly, in which case it would be better placed in bin/ again.\n\nFinally, we can always move aaa-cli-jar from bin/ if a superior script appears.\n\nOverall, I see no reason for merging this lib/bin/ version.",
