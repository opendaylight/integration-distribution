I cannot promise I will have time to do that this week.\n\nAs this is blocking me from progressing with https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/48901/, which I *really* would like to finally wrap up (I need to move on to other frontiers ASAP!), I\u0027ve gone ahead and started this in https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/49272/ ..\n\n\u003e It should be easy now\n\nWehl... not THAT easy - I\u0027m stuck in particular with 1 problem - care to take a look, and perhaps directly yourself amend c/49272 ?  I would abandon this if you can help to wrap that one up...\n\n\u003e migrating to odlparent:feature-repo-parent requires lots of typing (and typo fixing), so it can wait until more projects use that parent.\n\njust FYI: I\u0027m not really in a position to fully appreciate this... I\u0027m \"guessing\", and just learning from what I find is present, more than fully understanding what is exactly for what here... ;-)",
