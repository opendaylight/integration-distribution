Having important differences between them would be a pain to maintain.\n\nThe right thing would be to migrate to odlparent:features-parent. It should be easy now (when odlparent:opendaylight-karaf-empty is used in both places), but I cannot promise I will have time to do that this week.\n\nNote that migrating to odlparent:feature-repo-parent requires lots of typing (and typo fixing), so it can wait until more projects use that parent.",
