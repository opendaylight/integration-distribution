.. note:: Most projects get their YANG Tools version via MD-SAL.
  ${project}-artifacts are maven `bill of materials <https://howtodoinjava.com/maven/maven-bom-bill-of-materials-dependency/>`__
  (a.k.a. bom or BOM), whose use is strongly recommended to avoid versions
  mismatch across multiple dependencies in poms.
