It relates to scripts used in autorelease process, or when bumping version after stable branch is cut.\n\nI may be mistaken, possibly the scripts are more intelligent now, but I would feel safer if this becomes 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.\n\nYou can do the change in your project first (integration/distribution will keep downloading existing 1.0-SNAPSHOT stuff from Nexus) and then change the version here.",
